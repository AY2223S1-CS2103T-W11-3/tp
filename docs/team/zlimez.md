### Project: ArtBuddy

ArtBuddy is a desktop client management system built to help freelance artists manage
their clients and commissions easily. It is written in Java, with a GUI created with
JavaFx.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: 
  * Implement `addcom` - Adds commission to selected customer.
  * Implement `findcom` - Filters current commission list for those that contains the specified keyword and tags.
  * Implement `listcom` - Returns the original unfiltered commission list.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=zlimez)

* **Project management**: None 

* **Enhancements to existing features**: 
  * Polish image retrieval for iterations.
  * Merge keyword and tag filtering of customers into one `find` command.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide: Quickstart and `addcom` under Features.
    * Developer Guide: Target User Profile, Value Proposition and Use Cases.

* **Community**:
  * Suggested a bug in the original customer replacement pattern when updating a customer's commission list.
