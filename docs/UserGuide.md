## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* The file path specified should be an absolute path from your root directory.
* The command requires a commission to be selected.
* The image name will assume the filename specified in the command.
* Currently, only image file types .png, .jpg, .bmp and .gif are supported
* In addition, you can currently only upload one image per commission. Trying to add an image to a commission with an
  existing image will not be allowed. Your existing image will not be overridden, but the new image will not be added to
  your commission. To replace a commission image, first delete the image before adding a new image.

<summary><strong>What is a filepath and my root directory?</strong></summary>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: What is a filepath and my root directory?**<br>
Just like how we use addresses to tell specify locations when talking to people, computers
do the same! Each file in your computer has a unique address that can be used to identify the
exact location in your computer where the file is stored.

The address of each file in your computer can be viewed simply as "directions", guiding your
computer to get to the file. Think about how you would tell someone how to open a specific file
in your computer. You would probably say something along the lines of: "Go to the Downloads folder,
where you'll find an  Image folder. Click into the Images folder and open the file Draft1.png".

Well to computers, filepaths are just like these guiding instructions that help them locate
a specific file! And your 'root directory' is simply a 'base point' that stores all your files in
your computer. For most users using a Windows or Mac computer, this root directory is simply
a folder named `/`.

So what a file path `/Users/John/Downloads/Draft 1.png` really means is just a way of telling
the computer, "Hey, from my root directory, you'll find a folder called Users, and in there a
folder called John. Open that up and you'll find another folder called Downloads.
Open the Downloads folder and you'll see the file I want called `Draft 1.png`".

To easily copy a filepath of a file:
* On Windows, in your File Explorer, hold shift down while you right-click on the file you want.
Select the option `Copy as Path` and the filepath of your file will be copied!
* On Mac, in your Finder, click on the file you want to select it and press the
`Option`, `Command`, `C` keys simultaneously. The filepath of your file is now copied!
</div>
</details>

**Adding by Graphical Interface**

Adding an iteration can also be done via the graphical interface by clicking on
the `Add Iteration` button inside the Commission you wish to add the iteration to.

<img src="images/AddIterationButton.png" width="450" />

A new window will then pop up, where you will be prompted to fill in the details of
the new iteration. An image can be added to the iteration by selecting a file in
your file manager by clicking on the `Add Image` button, or by dragging and dropping
an image to the grey image drop area.

<img src="images/AddIterationWindow.png" width="450" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about images in ArtBuddy:**<br>

ArtBuddy creates a copy of each file you upload. This means that you can edit, delete, or
move your original copy of the file without affecting the uploaded image on ArtBuddy.
</div>

Example: `additer /Users/John/Downloads/Draft 1.png`

### Deleting iteration from commission: `deliter`
Deletes an iteration from a commission.

Format: `deliter [INDEX]`
* The command requires a commission to be selected.
* As each commission currently has only one image, the command will simply delete the image tied to the current commission, if it exists.
* You may want to note that your local copy of the image will not be deleted.

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

ArtBuddy data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
