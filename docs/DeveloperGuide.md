### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CustomerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Customer` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a customer).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCustomerCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCustomerCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the art buddy data i.e., all `Customer` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCustomerList` object).
* stores all `Commission` objects within their respective `Customer` object (which are contained in a `UniqueCommissionList` object).
* stores all `Iteration` objects within their respective `Commission` object (which are contained in a `UniqueIterationList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Customer` as an `ObservableObject<Customer>` which lets us listen to changes to the selected customer for performing UI updates.
* stores the current 'filtered' `Customer` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Customer>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the current list of `Commission` objects belonging to the selected `Customer` (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Commission>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Customer` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Customer` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Commissions
The class diagram below shows our current implementation of the `Commission` class.

<img src="images/Commission.png" width="450" />

Each commission in `ArtBuddy` contains...
- a `Title`
- a `Fee`
- a `Deadline`
- a `Completion Status`
- a `Set<Tags>` with any number of `Tag`s
- an *optional* `Description`
- a reference to its `Customer` object
- a `UniqueIterationList` containing its `Iteration`s

Commissions are currently stored in the individual `Customer`'s `UniqueCommissionList`.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect 1: Location to store the commission objects**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store all commission objects within their individual customer objects.
  * Pros:
    * Easy to implement.
    * Commands requiring commissions of a specific customer becomes more efficient.
  * Cons:
    * Commands requiring commissions from all customers are less efficient.
* **Alternative 2:** Store all commission objects in `AddressBook`.
  * Pros:
    * Commands requiring commissions from all customers can be more efficient.
  * Cons: 
    * More difficult to implement, since a deleted customer's commissions has to be individually deleted from this master list of commissions.
    * Less efficient for commands for an individual customer's commissions.

**Aspect 2: How to store the commission objects in `Customer`**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):**  create a `UniqueCommissionList` class
  * Pros:
    * Supports indexing of commissions already, which is convenient for most of our commands.
  * Cons:
    * Another class is necessary.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `Set<Commissions>`
  * Pros:
    * Individual customers' data does not require "ordering". Sets thus provide more efficient add/delete/find operations.
  * Cons:
    * Does not support indexing. Would still need another data structure in `ModelManager` when commands request commissions by index.
    * Edit becomes tedious to implement as it requires a combination of create and delete.

#### Deleting a Commission (`delcom`)

Deletes a commission based on user input, and deletes the commission from the active customer.

##### Implementation
This section explains how the `delcom` command is implemented.

Support for the `delcom` command is integrated with `DeleteCommissionCommandParser` and `DeleteCommissionCommand`.

It is important to note that our commission commands usually require retrieving the customer to operate on the customer's
commission list directly, due to our method of storing commissions (inside their Customer objects).

1. User specified arguments (the commission index) are passed to the DeleteCommissionCommandParser and the arguments are broken up by the ArgumentTokenizer and ArgumentMultimap.

1. The arguments will then be parsed by ParserUtil. An error will be thrown if the inputs were invalid or if no customer is selected yet.

1. A new DeleteCommissionCommand object will be initialised.

1. DeleteCommissionCommand#execute() will then get the currently shown list of commissions and identify the target commission to delete.

1. This commission is passed into Customer#removeCommission to be removed directly from the customer's commission list.

1. Model updates the GuiTab to show the Commission tab and selectedCommission to not show the deletedCommission and these changes are observed by the UI.

1. The success message will be returned to the user by the CommandResult.

The sequence diagram below shows the interaction between `Logic` and `Model` when `delcom 1` is executed.
The parser part is omitted for brevity, but it is very similar to the other commands.

<img src="images/DeleteCommissionCommand.png" width="450" />

### Iterations
Iterations help users keep track of the progress of their commissions. Each commission iteration
essentially represents a version of the commissioned artwork.

Iterations contain a `Date`, `IterationDescription`, `ImagePath`, and `Feedback`. Since
an iteration must be tied to a commission, this composition is captured by storing the
iterations in a `UniqueIterationList` inside the associated commission object.

<!-- TODO insert iteration class diagram here -->

#### Adding an Iteration (`additer`)
Creates an iteration based on the user input, and adds the iteration to the active commission.
<!-- TODO Users may either add an iteration via the command line or the GUI as described in the activity
diagram below. -->

<!-- TODO insert addIteration activity diagram here -->

##### Implementation
Support for the add iteration command is integrated with the `AddIterationParser`,
which enables ArtBuddy to parse user input into an `AddIterationCommand`. The
`AddIterationCommand` stores the iteration created from the user inputs. This
iteration is added to the active commission's `UniqueIterationList` when the
`AddIterationCommand` is executed by the `LogicManager`.

Note that if there is no presently active commission, the iteration will not be added.

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions within the Logic component when
the user inputs `additer d/2022-10-10 n/Changed the colour scheme. p//Users/john/Downloads/Draft 1.png
f/Updated colour scheme is much better`;

<!-- TODO insert addIteration sequence diagram here -->

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th customer in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new customer. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the customer was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the customer being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 500 customers, 2000 commissions and 8000 iterations without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The app should be designed for and used by a single user.
5. The app data should be stored in a human-editable text file and not a DBMS.
6. Images and other app assets should be stored locally and not in a remote server.
7. The app should be well tested with a coverage of above 65% to allow bugs to be found more easily.
8. The product should be usable on all standard screen resolutions above 1280x720.
9. The product should be packaged within a single JAR file with a filesize of up to 100MB.
